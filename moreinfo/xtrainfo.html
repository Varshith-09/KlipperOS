    <h2>Are you here to learn more about Klipper firmware???</h2>
    <h2 style="text-align: left; color: white; text-align: center;">We got your back here's the detailed overview of klipper firmware:</h2>
    <p>
      Klipper is a 3D printer firmware that's rapidly gaining popularity due to
      its high performance and flexibility. It's designed to provide a more
      responsive and efficient printing experience compared to traditional
      firmwares like Marlin.

    <h3 style="font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif; color: white; text-align: center;" >How does a Klipper work?</h3>
    <p> Unlike traditional firmwares that run on the printer's microcontroller, Klipper operates on a
        separate, more powerful computer. This allows for more complex calculations and tasks,
        resulting in faster print times and smoother movements. The communication between the
        computer and the printer is handled through a dedicated interface, ensuring a low-latency
        connection.</p>

            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td> HighPerformance: Klipper's architecture allows for faster print speeds, acceleration, and
                deceleration. This results in shorter print times and improved print quality.</td>
              <td> Steeper Learning Curve: Setting up and configuring Klipper can be more complex than
                traditional firmwares. Users may need to invest more time and effort to get started.</td>

              <td> AdvancedFeatures: Klipper supports a wide range of advanced features, including
                adaptive leveling, coasting, and voltage compensation. These features can help to
                improve print quality and reduce layer adhesion issues.</td>
              <td> Hardware Requirements: Klipper requires a separate computer or Raspberry Pi to run.
                This can add to the overall cost of the setup</td>
